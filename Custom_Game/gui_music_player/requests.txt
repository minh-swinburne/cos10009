write an introduction for that tutorial explaining why it's necessary and helpful to visualize the progress of a playing song on the GUI of a Music Player, and briefly introduce how we will carry out this task in Gosu, with a Ruby Gem called "ruby-audioinfo"

Make a detailed tutorial on how to draw a song progress bar for a GUI music player in Ruby with these steps:
1. install the Ruby gem "audioinfo" by running the command "gem install ruby-audioinfo" in terminal
2. require gem in the .rb file (i.e. add the line "require 'audioinfo'" to the start of the program)
3. initialize a variable in the class "AudioInfo" that loads an audio file from the provided path (e.g. info = AudioInfo.open("path/file.supported_extension")
4. get the length of an audio file (in seconds) using the method length (e.g. info.length)
5. calculate active passed time in seconds (only while on play) by comparing current time to song starting time, using Gosu.milliseconds method: passed time = (current time - starting time) / 1000; refresh the starting time when the song is being paused or stopped
6. calculate the progress bar's width: current width = max width * passed time / audio length
7. draw a rectangle with found width above a blank progress bar of full width
